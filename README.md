# Guessing Game - C Application

This is a simple C application developed as a learning project, exploring basic programming logic. The game is a **number guessing game** where a random number is generated, and the user tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts, depending on the selected difficulty level. The game also includes a **score counter**.

## Features

- **Random Number Generation**: A random number is generated for the user to guess.
- **Difficulty Levels**:
  - Easy: More attempts allowed.
  - Medium: Moderate number of attempts.
  - Hard: Fewer attempts for a greater challenge.
- **Score Counter**: Tracks the user's performance.
- Feedback to guide the user (e.g., "The number is higher" or "The number is lower").

## Technologies Used

- **C**: Core programming language.

## How It Works

1. The user selects a difficulty level:
   - Easy, Medium, or Hard.
2. A random number is generated within a range.
3. The user guesses the number within the allowed attempts for the chosen difficulty.
4. The game provides feedback (e.g., "higher" or "lower") to assist the user.
5. Points are calculated based on the number of attempts and difficulty level.

## Personal Note

This project was developed as part of my learning journey in programming with C. It helped me solidify my understanding of basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and random number generation.
